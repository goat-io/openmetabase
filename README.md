# Backoffice Metabase Test

This project contains a POC for using metabase as backoffice

As the open source version of metabase has limitations on how we can interact
with it we have created a fork and force enable the visibility of actions

## License

This project contains a modified version of Metabase, which is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0). See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for details about modifications and [LICENSE-AGPL](LICENSE-AGPL) for the full license text.

Our modifications are also licensed under AGPL-3.0. Source code for all modifications is available in this repository as patches in `apps/metabase-patches/patches/`.

## How it works

The apps/metabase-emb is a node project that generates the embedding link for a
given dashboard id and params

The apps/backoficce project is a basic react example that simply loads a given
dashboard using the url generated by the metabase-emb

## Develop the Metabase fork

### Run the project

You will need to run both the frontend and backend of metabase

to run the frontend just use for hot reloading of the frontend

```bash
yarn build-hot
``

then, run the backend using
```
